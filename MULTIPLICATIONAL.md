# Quantum Circuit Documentation

## Overview

This documentation explains a quantum circuit created using Qiskit and visualized with the IBM Quantum Composer widget. The circuit involves qubit initialization, Hadamard gates, and a Toffoli gate (CCX gate), ultimately measuring one qubit's state into a classical register.

## Quantum Circuit Description

The quantum circuit consists of the following steps:

1. Initialization:
   - Create a 3-qubit quantum register (`q0`).
   - Create a 1-bit classical register (`c0`).
   - Reset qubits `q0[0]`, `q0[1]`, and `q0[2]` to the |0> state.
   2. Quantum Gate Operations:
   - Apply a Hadamard gate (`H`) on qubits `q0[0]` and `q0[1]`.
   - Apply a Toffoli gate (`CCX`) with control qubits `q0[0]` and `q0[1]` and target qubit `q0[2]`.

3. Measurement:
   - Measure the final state of qubit `q0[2]` into classical register `c0[0]`.

4. Visualization:
   - The quantum circuit is visualized using the IBM Quantum Composer widget, allowing for an interactive exploration of the circuit.
